# App Annie Status Board

This is a script that generates a downloads graph for Panic's Status Board using the App Annie API. It is based on Tim Br√ºckmann's [AppAnnieStatusBoard](https://github.com/rheinfabrik/AppAnnieStatusBoard). I'll keep his installation steps (just adapted to the needs of my version) in here to make the installation easier. If you like it thank [Tim](https://twitter.com/tibr), not me. I just adapted a few lines. ;-)

### Installation

1. Open `app_annie_status_board_downloads.rb` and adjust the values inside the configuration block to match you're respective install. To find out how to get the *app_id* see the section below.
2. Open `app_annie_status_board_downloads.sh` and update its path to the `app_annie_status_board_downloads.rb` script to match where you've installed it
3. Open `de.flohei.appanniestatusboard.downloads.plist` and update its `ProgramArguments` value to match where you are storing the salesboard.sh file you just updated in step 3.
4. Copy de.flohei.appanniestatusboard.downloads.plist to `~/Library/LaunchAgents` 
5. Open Termimal and run `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/de.flohei.appanniestatusboard.downloads.plist`. This should generate the first version of your json file.
6. Go to Dropbox and get a shareable link for the JSON file that is output and add it to Status Board on your iPad.

#### Get app_id

To get the *app_id* you'll need your *account_id*. If you already got that one read only the second paragraph.

1. Run ``curl --basic --user <user>:<password> "https://api.appannie.com/v1/accounts?page_index=0"`` in your Terminal. This will return your *account_id* along with some other information about your account. ``<user>`` and ``<password>`` are your appannie.com credentials.

2. Running ``curl --basic --user <user>:<password> "https://api.appannie.com/v1/accounts/<account_id>/apps"`` in the Terminal will return all your app's data. One of those fields is the *app_id*. This is what you want.
